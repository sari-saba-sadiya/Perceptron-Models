For students in cse440 introduction for artificial intellegence, Fall 2021.

As seen in class, the perceptron is a simplified model of a biological neuron that can learn to perform classification tasks. While relatively simple, these classifiers perform surprisingly well even on non-trivial tasks such as hand written digit recognition and tumor classification.

## Class Assignment
Complete the weight update function for the binary perceptron class (in assignment/perceptron_binary.ipynb)

## Project
This assignment will walk you through the implementation and testing of a multiclass perceptron classifier.
